# Anti-Leecher for Nicotine

An modified plugin that bans, ignores leechers without sending them a message.
This also Un-bans and Un-ignore users who are now sharing. This does require the banned user to re-log into Soulseek.  

Working with Nicotine+ V3.3.0

This works for my setup, but may not work with yours.
