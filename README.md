# Ban-SSLeechers  

A Nicotine+ plugin that bans and ignores users who think file sharing is optional. Spoiler: it’s not.

## What is this?  

A **personal plugin** for [Nicotine+](https://github.com/Nicotine-Plus/nicotine-plus).  
It does exactly what it says:

- Users who don't share enough files and folders? Banned and ignored.  
- If the user's IP has resolved, they can be banned. If it's unresolved, they won't be IP banned.  
- Optionally, send them a message telling them to stop leeching — or not. (Why waste bandwidth on people who don’t contribute?)

## Why?  

Because this is **Soulseek, not Soul-take**.  
If you're here just to download and not contribute, go use Spotify or rip YouTube.  
I'd rather share with those who share back.

## Installation  

1. Drop the plugin into your Nicotine+ `plugins` folder.  
2. Go to **Plugins → Enable** it.  
3. Configure it: set minimum files/folders shared, and the optional warning message.  
4. Done.

## FAQ  

**Q: Isn’t this gatekeeping?**  
**A:** Yes. That’s the point. It’s meant to encourage users who actually share. If you don’t like it, don’t use it.

**Q: But I only share 1 file because I’m shy… or have no bandwidth...**  
**A:** Understood. But this plugin prioritizes sharing — and rewards those who contribute.
