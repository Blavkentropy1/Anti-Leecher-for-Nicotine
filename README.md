# Ban-SSLeechers  

A Nicotine+ plugin that bans and ignores people who think file sharing is optional. Spoiler: it’s not.  

---

## What is this?  

This is my **personal plugin** for [Nicotine+](https://github.com/Nicotine-Plus/nicotine-plus).  
It does exactly what it says:  

* If a user does not share enough files +  folders, they are  banned + ignored.  
* Optionally, you can send them a message telling them to stop being a leech, Or not. (I prefer not to waste the bandwidth.)

## Why?  

Because this is **Soulseek, not Soul-take**.  
If you want to sit there and be a leecher, go use Spotify or rip YouTube.  
I’d rather give to users who share — and only those users.

## Installation  

1. Drop the plugin into your Nicotine+ `plugins` folder.  
2. Go to Plugins, and Enable it.  
3. Configure it however you want — minimum files/folders, optional warning message.  
4. Done.

## FAQ  

**Q: Isn’t this gatekeeping?**  
A: Yes. That’s the point. This is the simlar things like Private Trackers Thrive. 

**Q: But I only share 1 file because I’m shy… don’t have the bandwidth… don’t have storage… etc.**  
A: Cool story. Still banned.
